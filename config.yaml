  verbose:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: Enable verbose logging.
  use-syslog:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Setting this to True will allow supporting services to log to syslog.
  openstack-origin:
    type: string
    default: distro
    description: |
      Repository from which to install. May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Ubuntu Cloud Archive e.g.

      cloud archives are available and supported.
      .
      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade unless
      action-managed-upgrade is set to True.
  action-managed-upgrade:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
  harden:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Apply system hardening. Supports a space-delimited list of modules
      to run. Supported modules currently include os, ssh, apache and mysql.
  database-user:

    default: glance
    description: Glance database name.

      Comma-separated list of key=value pairs to be added to glance-api.conf
      where 'value' may itself be a comma-separated list of values to be
      assigned to the 'key'.
  registry-config-flags:

      Comma-separated list of key=value pairs to be added to
      glance-registry.conf where 'value' may itself be a comma-separated list
      of values to be assigned to the 'key'.
  region:
    type: string
    default: RegionOne
    description: OpenStack Region
  use-internal-endpoints:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Openstack mostly defaults to using public endpoints for
      internal communication between services. If set to True this option will
      configure services to use internal endpoints where possible.
  ceph-osd-replication-count:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
      object it stores within the images rbd pool. Of course, this only
      applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the images
      rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
      effect (although it can be changed in ceph by manually configuring
      your ceph cluster).
  ceph-pool-weight:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Defines a relative weighting of the pool as a percentage of the total
      amount of data in the Ceph cluster. This effectively weights the number
      of placement groups for the pool created to be appropriately portioned
      to the amount of data expected. For example, if the compute images
      for the OpenStack compute instances are expected to take up 20% of the
      overall configuration then this value would be specified as 20. Note -
      it is important to choose an appropriate value for the pool weight as
      this directly affects the number of placement groups which will be
      created for the pool. The number of placement groups for a pool can
      only be increased, never decreased - so it is important to identify the
      percent of data that will likely reside in the pool.
  restrict-ceph-pools:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Optionally restrict Ceph key permissions to access pools as required.
  worker-multiplier:
    type: float
    default:
    description: |
      The CPU core multiplier to use when configuring worker processes for
      Glance. By default, the number of workers for each daemon is set to
      twice the number of CPU cores a service unit has. When deployed in
      a LXD container, this default value will be capped to 4 workers
      unless this configuration option is set.
  expose-image-locations:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      Expose underlying image locations via the API when using Ceph for image
      storage. Only disable this option if you do not wish to use
      copy-on-write clones of RAW format images with Ceph in Cinder and Nova.
  restrict-image-location-operations:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If this is set to True, all *_image_location operations in the Glance api
      will be restricted to role:admin which will result in non-admin users no
      longer being able to view the "locations" information for an image.
      This only affects environments that have expose-image-locations set to
      True.
      WARNING: enabling this restriction will cause Nova to no longer be able
      to create COW clones or snapshots for non-admin users when using the
      RBDImageBackend in the nova-compute charm. 
  rabbit-user:
    type: string
    default: glance
    description: Username to request access on rabbitmq-server.
  rabbit-vhost:

  disk-formats:
    type: string
    default: ami,ari,aki,vhd,vmdk,raw,qcow2,vdi,iso,root-tar
    description: |
      Comma separated list of disk formats that Glance will support.
  image-size-cap:
    type: string
    default: 1TB
    description: |
      Maximum size of image a user can upload. Defaults to 1TB
      (1099511627776 bytes). Example values: 500M, 500MB, 5G, 5TB.
      Valid units: K, KB, M, MB, G, GB, T, TB, P, PB. If no units provided,
      bytes are assumed.
      .
      WARNING: this value should only be increased after careful consideration
      and must be set to a value under 8EB (9223372036854775808 bytes).

  ssl_cert:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      SSL certificate to install and use for API ports. Setting this value
      and ssl_key will enable reverse proxying, point Glance's entry in the
      Keystone catalog to use https, and override any certificate and key
      issued by Keystone (if it is configured to do so).

    description: |
      The hostname or address of the public endpoints created for glance
      in the keystone identity provider.
      .
      This value will be used for public endpoints. For example, an
      os-public-hostname set to 'glance.example.com' with ssl enabled will
      create a public endpoint for glance of:
      .

      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  # Monitoring config
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm. A string that will
      be prepended to instance name to set the host name in nagios. So for
      instance the hostname would be something like 'juju-myservice-0'. If
      you are running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:

      Upon start up, Glance creates the directory if it doesn’t already exist
      and verifies write access to the user under which glance-api runs. If
      the write access isn’t available, a BadStoreConfiguration exception is
      raised and the filesystem store may not be available for adding new
      images. NOTE: This directory is used only when filesystem store is used
      as a storage backend.
  use-policyd-override:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True then use the resource file named 'policyd-override' to install
      override YAML files in the service's policy.d directory.  The resource
      file should be a ZIP file containing at least one yaml file with a .yaml
      or .yml extension.  If False then remove the overrides.
